# Repository Cleanup Guide

This repository has been cleaned up for GitHub submission. Here's what was done:

## Updated .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude:
- System files (.DS_Store)
- Environment files (.env, .env.example)
- Temporary and backup files (*.bak, *.old, *.tmp, *.log)
- Archive files (*.zip, *.tar, *.gz)
- IDE files (.idea/, .vscode/)
- PM2 configuration files
- Bytecode dumps
- Non-production deployment logs
- Failed deployment files
- Verification results
- Test deployment files

## Cleanup Script Usage

A cleanup script `cleanup-repo.sh` has been created to remove unnecessary files.

### How to use:

1. **First, do a dry run to see what will be deleted:**
   ```bash
   ./cleanup-repo.sh --dry-run
   ```

2. **If you're satisfied with what will be removed, run the actual cleanup:**
   ```bash
   ./cleanup-repo.sh
   ```

3. **After cleanup, review changes:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

4. **Add and commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Clean up repository for GitHub"
   ```

## What Gets Removed

The script removes:
- All .DS_Store files
- .env and .env.example files
- Temporary bytecode files (atlantis_bytecode.txt, etc.)
- test-pm2.js
- yalp-keeper-bot.zip and folder
- Non-production deployment logs
- Failed deployment JSON files
- Verification result JSON files
- Timestamped test deployment files

## What Is Preserved

The script preserves:
- All contract source files
- Core deployment scripts
- Production deployment logs (sonic and superseed)
- Documentation
- Test files in the test/ directory
- TypeChain generated files

## Important Notes

- Always backup your repository before running cleanup
- The script will NOT delete any source code or important contracts
- Debug and test scripts in scripts/ are preserved (but can be ignored via .gitignore if desired)
- If you need any of the deployment JSON files for reference, save them before running the cleanup

## Post-Cleanup

After running the cleanup and pushing to GitHub:
- The repository will be much cleaner and smaller
- Sensitive environment files will not be exposed
- Temporary and test files won't clutter the repository
- Future commits will automatically ignore these file types
