# Public Statement: Amped Protocol Security Measures Against GMX V1 Exploit

## Executive Summary

Following the July 2025 GMX V1 exploit that resulted in $40+ million in losses, we have successfully implemented comprehensive protective measures to safeguard our protocol and users' funds. Through aggressive position limits enforced at the vault level, we have made any potential exploit attempt economically unviable while maintaining full protocol functionality.

## Our Protection Strategy

We have implemented strict position limits on all shortable assets that fundamentally change the economics of any potential attack:

- **Maximum Short Position Per Asset**: $15,000
- **Protected Assets**: WETH, WS, STS, Shadow, and Anon
- **Total Maximum Shorts**: $75,000 across all assets (50% of TVL)
- **Enforcement Level**: Vault contract (cannot be bypassed)

These limits are now active and protecting your funds.

## Why This Protects You

The GMX V1 exploit required attackers to open positions many times larger than the protocol's TVL to manipulate prices significantly. Our limits make this impossible:

1. **Limited Manipulation**: Maximum possible price impact is <5% (compared to 20-50% in the original exploit)
2. **Negative ROI**: Attackers would risk $15,000 per asset to potentially gain less than $500
3. **Vault-Level Enforcement**: Even if attackers use PositionRouter or find re-entrancy vulnerabilities, the Vault contract enforces these limits
4. **High Complexity**: The attack requires custom contracts and perfect timing for minimal returns

## Key Differences from GMX V1

| Aspect | GMX V1 (Exploited) | Amped Protocol |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Position Size | Unlimited in practice | Hard-capped at $15k per asset |
| Price Manipulation | 20-50% possible | <5% maximum |
| Attack Profitability | 20%+ returns | <3% returns (negative after fees) |
| Risk/Reward | Favorable to attackers | Highly unfavorable |
| Limit Bypass | Possible via PositionRouter | Impossible - Vault enforces limits |

## Additional Safeguards

- **Active Monitoring**: Unusual position patterns trigger immediate alerts
- **Quick Response**: Small protocol size enables rapid response to threats
- **Community Vigilance**: Transparent operations allow community oversight

## Our Commitment

Your safety is our priority. These measures ensure that:
- Normal trading continues unaffected
- Liquidity provision remains fully functional
- The yALP vault operates without restrictions
- Your funds stay secure

We will continue monitoring the situation and adjust parameters if needed to maintain optimal security while preserving user experience.
