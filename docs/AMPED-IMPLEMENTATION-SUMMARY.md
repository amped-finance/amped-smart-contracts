# AMPED Token Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete AMPED token ecosystem on the new "AMPED" branch. This implementation introduces the AMPED token as the user-facing token while maintaining AMP as the internal protocol token for staking and rewards.

## What Was Created

### 1. **AMPED Token** (`contracts/tokens/AmpedToken.sol`)
- ERC20 token with LayerZero OFT V2 support for cross-chain functionality
- Governance capabilities (ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit)
- 1 billion token initial supply
- Pausable for emergency situations
- Deployed with Solidity 0.8.20 for latest security features

### 2. **AMP Token** (`contracts/tokens/AMP.sol`)
- Simple mintable token following existing GMX pattern
- Used internally by the protocol for staking
- Compatible with existing 0.6.12 contract ecosystem

### 3. **Router Contracts**

#### **AmpedSwapRouter** (`contracts/staking/AmpedSwapRouter.sol`)
- Handles AMPED <-> AMP token swaps
- Supports both internal swaps (configurable ratio) and external DEX integration
- Slippage protection and price oracle support
- Admin functions for liquidity management

#### **AmpedStakingRouter** (`contracts/staking/AmpedStakingRouter.sol`)
- Allows users to stake AMPED tokens directly
- Automatically swaps AMPED to AMP and stakes via RewardRouterV2
- Supports ETH deposits that convert to AMPED then AMP
- Integrates seamlessly with existing staking infrastructure

#### **AmpedRewardsRouter** (`contracts/staking/AmpedRewardsRouter.sol`)
- Claims rewards from all sources (AMP, esAMP, WS fees)
- Converts rewards to AMPED before sending to users
- Supports selective claiming and conversion
- View functions to check claimable amounts

### 4. **Deployment Scripts**
- `scripts/tokens/deployAmpedToken.js` - Deploys AMPED token
- `scripts/staking/deployAmpedRouters.js` - Deploys all router contracts

### 5. **Documentation**
- `docs/AMPED-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment and configuration guide
- `docs/AMPED-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Key Design Decisions

### Token Architecture
- **AMPED**: User-facing token with cross-chain capabilities
- **AMP**: Internal protocol token for staking mechanics
- **Seamless Conversion**: Routers handle all conversions transparently

### Integration Points
1. **Staking**: Users stake AMPED → Router swaps to AMP → Stakes in protocol
2. **Rewards**: Protocol distributes AMP/esAMP/WS → Router swaps to AMPED → User receives AMPED
3. **Cross-chain**: AMPED can move between chains via LayerZero

### Security Features
- Pausable tokens for emergency response
- Slippage protection on all swaps
- Handler-based access control
- Governance controls on critical functions

## Touch Points Addressed

All major user interaction points now support AMPED:
- ✅ Token staking (via AmpedStakingRouter)
- ✅ Reward claiming (via AmpedRewardsRouter)
- ✅ Fee distribution (WS fees converted to AMPED)
- ✅ Escrowed tokens (esAMP handled separately)
- ✅ Cross-chain transfers (LayerZero OFT)

## Deployment Process

1. Deploy AMPED token with LayerZero endpoint
2. Deploy AMP token (if not existing)
3. Deploy router contracts
4. Configure swap ratios and liquidity
5. Set permissions on RewardRouterV2
6. Configure cross-chain trusted remotes

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all new contracts
   - Integration tests with existing protocol
   - Cross-chain transfer testing

2. **Audit Preparation**
   - Review all state-changing functions
   - Verify access controls
   - Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to Sonic testnet first
   - Verify all contracts
   - Test with small amounts
   - Gradual mainnet rollout

## Technical Notes

- Updated `hardhat.config.js` to support both Solidity 0.6.12 and 0.8.20
- Router contracts use 0.6.12 for compatibility with existing protocol
- AMPED token uses 0.8.20 for latest features and security
- All contracts follow established patterns from the codebase

## Gas Optimization

- Batch operations where possible
- Efficient storage layout
- Minimal external calls
- Optimized compiler settings

This implementation provides a complete solution for introducing AMPED as the user-facing token while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Amped Finance protocol infrastructure.
