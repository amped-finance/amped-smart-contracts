# Introducing yALP: The Future of Automated Yield on Sonic

We're excited to announce the launch of yALP (Yield Bearing ALP), a revolutionary advancement in how liquidity providers interact with the Amped protocol on Sonic. This EIP-4626 compliant vault transforms the liquidity provision experience by introducing auto-compounding yields and unprecedented flexibility for ALP holders.

## What is yALP?

yALP is a tokenized vault that wraps your ALP (Amped Liquidity Provider) tokens into a yield-bearing asset that automatically compounds rewards. Instead of manually claiming and reinvesting your trading fees and esAMP rewards, yALP does this for you, maximizing your returns through the power of compound interest.

### EIP-4626: The Tokenized Vault Standard

yALP implements EIP-4626, the standardized interface for tokenized vaults. This standard, pioneered by developers including Joey Santoro (Fei Protocol) and others, creates a common framework for yield-bearing vaults across DeFi. By adhering to EIP-4626, yALP ensures:

- **Composability**: Seamless integration with other DeFi protocols that support the standard
- **Predictable Behavior**: Standardized functions like `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `totalAssets()`, and conversion functions
- **Developer Friendly**: Any protocol or tool that works with EIP-4626 vaults automatically works with yALP
- **Future Proof**: As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, yALP remains compatible with new innovations

The standard defines precise mathematical relationships between shares (yALP) and assets (fsALP), ensuring fair and transparent accounting that users and protocols can rely on.

### The Power of Auto-Compounding

Traditional ALP holders must regularly claim their rewards and manually reinvest them to benefit from compounding. This process is:
- Time-consuming and requires active management
- Requires multiple transactions and constant monitoring
- Easy to forget, leading to suboptimal returns
- Inefficient for users who want passive exposure

With yALP, all of this happens automatically. Your share of trading fees (distributed as WS - Wrapped Sonic) is continuously reinvested into more ALP, growing your position without any action required on your part.

## Key Benefits for Liquidity Providers

### 1. **Set and Forget Yield Generation**
Once you've deposited into yALP, your position automatically grows. The vault's keeper regularly harvests rewards and reinvests them, ensuring you're always earning maximum yield. This passive approach is perfect for long-term liquidity providers who want exposure to Amped's growth without active management.

### 2. **Operational Efficiency**
Instead of every user needing to manually claim and reinvest rewards individually, the yALP vault handles this automatically. One compound transaction benefits all vault participants simultaneously, creating a more efficient system for everyone involved.

### 3. **Transferable Liquidity**
Unlike fsALP (staked ALP) which is non-transferable and locked to your wallet, yALP tokens are fully transferable ERC-20 tokens. This opens up exciting new possibilities:

- **Trade on DEXs**: yALP can be traded on Sonic DEXs, providing instant liquidity
- **Use as Collateral**: Potential integration with lending protocols
- **Transfer Between Wallets**: Move your position without unstaking
- **Gift or Distribute**: Easy distribution for DAOs or investment funds

### 4. **Transparent Tracking**
The vault provides complete transparency with:
- `lastDeposit`: See exactly when the last deposit or compound occurred
- `withdrawalsAvailableAt()`: Know precisely when you can withdraw (after the 15-minute cooldown)
- Real-time exchange rate: Track how much your yALP has grown compared to regular ALP

### 5. **Fair Share Distribution**
The vault uses a sophisticated share calculation mechanism that prevents dilution attacks and ensures every depositor receives their fair share of the vault's growth. Early depositors are protected, and new depositors can't game the system.

## Trading yALP on Sonic DEXs

One of the most exciting aspects of yALP is its potential for secondary market trading. As an ERC-20 token, yALP can be:

### Listed on Sonic DEXs
Liquidity pools pairing yALP with S (Sonic), stablecoins, or other assets can provide instant liquidity for yALP holders. This means you can exit your liquidity position instantly through a DEX rather than waiting for the cooldown period.

### Price Discovery
The market will price yALP based on:
- Current ALP backing per yALP token
- Expected future yield from the protocol
- Demand for passive ALP exposure
- Overall Amped protocol growth

### Arbitrage Opportunities
Sophisticated traders can arbitrage between:
- Direct ALP minting/redemption through yALP
- yALP market prices on DEXs
- This creates efficient markets and ensures yALP trades near its fair value

## Technical Implementation

yALP leverages sophisticated mechanisms to ensure security, fairness, and efficiency:

### Core Architecture

- **Deposit with S**: Simple one-transaction deposits using Sonic's native token via `depositS()`
- **Automatic Reward Reinvestment**: Keeper-managed compounding of WS (Wrapped Sonic) rewards
- **Exchange Rate Mechanism**: The vault maintains a precise exchange rate between yALP and fsALP, calculated as:
  ```
  1 yALP = (Total fsALP in Vault) / (Total yALP Supply)
  ```
  This rate only increases as rewards are compounded, never decreases

### Security Features

- **Dilution Protection**: The vault calculates shares based on the state *before* deposits, preventing sandwich attacks and ensuring fair share distribution
- **Reentrancy Guards**: All state-changing functions are protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Non-Custodial Design**: Users can always redeem their yALP for the underlying fsALP
- **Cooldown Management**: Respects the underlying 15-minute GlpManager cooldown, tracked via `lastDeposit` timestamp

### Smart Contract Details

The yALP vault integrates with Amped's core infrastructure:
- **RewardRouter**: Handles minting and staking of ALP tokens
- **GlpManager**: Manages liquidity operations and cooldowns
- **fsALP**: The underlying fee + staked ALP tokens that back yALP

Key functions exposed to users:
```solidity
// Deposit S and receive yALP
function depositS(uint256 minUsdg, uint256 minGlp) external payable returns (uint256 shares)

// Burn yALP and receive S
function withdrawS(uint256 shares, uint256 minOut, address receiver) external returns (uint256 amountOut)

// View functions for transparency
function totalAssets() public view returns (uint256)  // Total fsALP in vault
function lastDeposit() public view returns (uint256)   // Last deposit timestamp
function withdrawalsAvailableAt() public view returns (uint256)  // When withdrawals unlock
```

### Compound Mechanism

The keeper-controlled `compound()` function:
1. Claims accumulated WS rewards from trading fees
2. Unwraps WS to native S tokens
3. Deposits S back into the protocol for more fsALP
4. Updates the exchange rate, benefiting all yALP holders proportionally

This process is transparent and emits events that can be monitored on-chain.

## Getting Started

Interacting with yALP is straightforward:

1. **Deposit**: Send S (Sonic) to the vault using `depositS()` 
2. **Hold**: Watch your yALP appreciate as rewards are compounded
3. **Trade** (optional): Trade yALP on Sonic DEXs for instant liquidity
4. **Withdraw**: Burn yALP to receive S after the cooldown period
